# A learning Project for GANs

Starting out:
    - use a pytorch dataset to work on image generation using a GAN
    
Next Steps:
    - create personal dataset for image generation


NOTE:   
    - wanted to do some ML that would run better on GPU 
    - single epoch using current commit:
        - CPU: 213 Seconds
        - GPU: 30 Seconds
